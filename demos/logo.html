    Logo Components

    Logos should always have a link back to the index of th website

    The logo may appear as an <img> element within a hyperlink, or as the
    background image to a hyperlink.

    If used as a straight <img> element, always link to our @2x version of the logo.

    If used as a background image, then make sure to use a class that calls the retina mixin to show the @2x image on retina displays and normal resolution on standard displays.

    Also include the a text equivalent of the logo within a <span> element that is hidden from the browser but accessible to screen readers.
