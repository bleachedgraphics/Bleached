    Usage of the Aside <aside> Element


    An aside can be a sidebar, but it is not defined
    as being a sidebar.

    Use an aside to represent secondary content pertaining
    to an article (as displayed in example 1) or use as
    secondary content to the MAIN content of a page
    (as displayed in example 2).

    Example 1:

    Aside is related to the content of the <article>
    but is supplementary to it.

  Aside is secondary to content on the page.
  The primary content displayed within the <main> element.
