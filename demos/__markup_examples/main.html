    Usage of the Main <main> Element


    The <main> element represents the primary content within the
    <body> element of a document or application.

    Content within the <main> element should be unique to the overall
    document and exclude any repeating content such as sidebars, global
    navigation, headers, footers, copyright information and other
    reoccurring content blocks.

    There can be only one <main> element per document and can not
    be a child of <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header> or <nav>.

    Combine the <main> element with the ARIA role="main" as the
    element is not yet supported widely.
