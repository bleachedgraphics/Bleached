    Paragraph Element

    As the name implies, a paragraph element represents a paragraph
    of text. It should not be used as a means to label elements
    or contain text / other elements that are not meant to be
    paragraphs or at least sentences of text.

-->



<!--

    Example 1:

    Standard use of a paragraph element.

-->

<p>
  This text is within a paragraph element.
</p>


<!--

    Example 2:

    Paragraph within an anchor element. This is allowed in
    HTML5 and may be useful in cases where a larger 'hit area'
    for a call to action is required.

-->

<a href="#!">
  <p>
    This text is within a paragraph, within an anchor element.
  </p>
</a>
