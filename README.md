# Brass Tacks

Brass Tacks is (will be) a professional front-end HTML5 and SCSS framework that incorporates and standardizes many
widely used HTML and CSS elements.

Brass Tacks was built quietly over many years of standardizing the way I write my code, and incorporating 
the best practices of other web designers and developers in the field.  

Many other developers have had a hand in helping me shape Brass Tacks' outcome. I will list them here and 
likely rewrite this into later.

A current(likely not current) build can be viewed at http://brass-tacks.scott-ohara.mixture.io/ (for now)


## Brass Tacks Specifics

* HTML5 ready building and general styling
* Modern Browser friendly with compatibility for IE8+ (untested)

* Google Analytics placeholder
* HTML5shiv via CDN, with local fallback file
* jQuery 1.10.2 via CDN, with a local fallback file
* IE-Specific classes on the HTML element for easer cross-browser control.

* Various HTML ready-to-use snippets
* CSS base, helper and project classes

* Extensive inline and accompanying documentation (partially -- as in barely any at all yet -- complete)

<hr />

<strong>Brass Tacks</strong> is a Sass based, Object Oriented CSS / HTML5 framework that I've been building over the last few years.

Look to this area (or other readme files) for extended documentation and best practices.

This is still earlyish in development, and won't be considered 'complete' until reaching v 1.0 stage.

With that said, there is plenty here that 'could' be used for a project now. I'd appreciate any feedback on this if people 
choose to give it a shot n' toy around with.

<hr />

Credit to normalize.css's HTML example for providing a good base of HTML tags to test from and to 
use as a list of tags to consider for this foundation and tags that are just not important in
the majority of website projects I've been involved with.
