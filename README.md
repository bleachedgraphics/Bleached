# Brass Tacks (Last updated: 0.8.0 - Dec. 9, 2013)

Brass Tacks is (will be) a professional front-end HTML5 and SCSS framework that incorporates and
standardizes many widely used HTML and CSS elements.

Brass Tacks was oficially started in mid-2013, but really is based on the evolution of my
coding style over many years. I have learned a lot from other developers in my field, and
continue to do so on a daily basis. Those developers, as well as my own experiences have
significantly steered the path of Brass Tacks' development.

Once Brass Tacks reaches the 1.0 release, there will be a full listing of thank yous to the
many people who's work has influenced this framework.

As of version 0.8.0, much of the code from previous releases has been significantly rewritten.
Until a final 1.0 stamp can be put on the code, there won't be a 'live' version of the framework
available for viewing.

Look to this area (or other readme files) for extended documentation and best practices.


## Brass Tacks Specifics

* HTML5 ready building and general styling
* Modern Browser friendly with compatibility for IE9+ with fallbacks for IE8

* Google Analytics placeholder
* HTML5shiv via CDN, with local fallback file
* Various HTML ready-to-use snippets
* CSS base, helper and project files

* Extensive inline and accompanying documentation (partially complete -- as in barely any at all yet -- this WILL exist by v 1.0)

<hr />

Even though Brass Tacks isn't finished, there is plenty here that 'could' be used for a project now.
So go ahead and fork, download and use what's availabe in your project.  I'd love to get any feedback
on the framework that you may have!
